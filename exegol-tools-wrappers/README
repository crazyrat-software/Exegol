This is a simple yet effective tool to create wrapper scripts for all tools included in Exegol images. 

The idea is to propagate "tools" file with all the tool names included in Exegol Docker image. Good starting point is official list in .CSV format available here (https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol-docs/tree/main/source/assets/installed_tools).

Configuration is simple and is kept in "config" file which is sourced to all wrapper scripts for customization puproses.
Config variables are as follows:
### EXEGOL_BIN_PAT - location of config, list and all the wrapper scripts. Should be added to system PATH environment variable.
### EXEGOL_ENV - name of the Exegol Docker image being used.
### EXEGOL_PREFIX - prefix added before each wrapper script to be easily distinguidhed from regular binaries while using autocomplete in your terminal.
